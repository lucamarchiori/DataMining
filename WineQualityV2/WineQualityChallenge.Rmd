# Wine Quality Challenge
## Instructions
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the predicted value and the observed quality. 

RMSE = sqrt(mean((y â€“ haty)^2)) 

## Dataset colums
1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol
12. quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Init
```{r}
# Load libraries
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(ggbiplot)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
#Clear the workspace
rm(list=ls())
```

## Data import
```{r}
# Load the training data
train <- read.csv("wineq_train.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
# Load the test data
test <- read.csv("wineq_validation.csv", , stringsAsFactors=F)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
# Compactly Display the Structure of an Arbitrary R Object
str(train)

# Take an initial view of the dataset
summary(train)
```
All the features are numeric, no qualitative data is present. The quality is the target variable and since it can be considered as a continuous variable, we can use regression models to predict it.

### Scatterplots
With the following scatterplots, we can see the relationship between the quality and the other features. Each level of quality is represented by a different color.
```{r}
# Scatterplot matrix, with different colors for each quality level
pairs(train, col = train$quality, upper.panel = NULL, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Single scatterplots of features against quality
# plot(train$alcohol, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$total.sulfur.dioxide, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$free.sulfur.dioxide, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$volatile.acidity, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$fixed.acidity, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$pH, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$density, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$sulphates, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$chlorides, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$residual.sugar, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
# plot(train$citric.acid, train$quality, col = train$quality, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

```

### Principal Component Analysis
```{r}
# Principal Component Analysis
pca <- prcomp(train[,1:12], scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)

# Biplot with GGplot2
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(pca, obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1, groups = train$quality, ellipse = TRUE, circle = TRUE, varname.size = 3, varname.adjust = 3, varname.color = "orange", varname.face = "bold") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10), legend.text = element_text(size = 10)) +
  ggtitle("PCA Biplot")
```




### Correlation heatmap
```{r}
corrplot(cor(train[,1:12]), method = "number", tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7, number.cex = 0.7)
```

## Feature selection
```{r}
baseModel <- lm(quality ~ 1, data = train)
FwStepSel <- step(baseModel, direction = "forward", scope = list(lower = baseModel, upper = lm(quality ~ ., data = train)))


#Based on the previous step results:
fit = lm(formula = FwStepSel$call$formula, data = train)
```


### Decision trees
```{r}

# Decision tree

# Fit a complete decision tree
dTreefit <- rpart(quality ~ ., data = train, method = "anova", cp = 0.005)

# Plot the decision tree
rpart.plot(fit, type = 4, extra = 101, under = TRUE, fallen.leaves = TRUE, cex = 0.5, tweak = 1.2)

# Fit a decision tree on a few features
dTreefit <- rpart(quality ~ . -citric.acid - chlorides - total.sulfur.dioxide - density, data=train)
rpart.plot(dTreefit)
yhat = predict(dTreefit, newdata=test)
write.table(file="fitDecisionTree.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)


confusionMatrix(yhat, test$quality)

```

### Random forest
```{r}
# Train the random forest model with all features
rForestfit <- randomForest(quality ~ ., train)

# Get the importance of each feature and plot it
importance <- importance(rForestfit)
varImpPlot(rForestfit)

# Predict the quality of the test set with all features
yhat = predict(rForestfit, newdata=test)
write.table(file="fitRandomForestAllFeaturs", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

# Train the random forest model with selected features
rForestfit <- randomForest(quality ~ . - sulphates - fixed.acidity - residual.sugar, train)
yhat = predict(rForestfit, newdata=test)
write.table(file="fitRandomForestSubsetFeaturs", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
<!-- ### Fit a basic linear model -->
The lm function is used to create linear models.
`quality ~ .` is the formula provided to the lm() function. In R modeling formulas, the tilde ~ separates the outcome variable from the predictor variables. In this case, quality is the outcome variable, and . means "all other variables in the data frame". So essentially, it's saying "predict quality using all other variables in the train data frame".

`data=train` specifies the data frame to be used for fitting the model. In this case, it's using the train data frame.

`predict()` is a function in R used to generate predictions from various types of models, including linear regression models. The argument `newdata=test` specifies the data frame (test) for which we want to predict the outcome quality variable.

In summary, use the linear regression model (`fit`) to predict the outcome variable for the observations in the test data frame, and store these predictions in the variable `yhat`.

```{r}
fit = lm(quality ~ ., data=train)
summary(fit)
yhat = predict(fit, newdata=test)

# Put the prediction in a file for the submission on the platform
write.table(file="fitLinearModelVBasic.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

## Computing Minimal Squared Error
MSE (Mean Squared Error) is a common metric for evaluating the performance of regression models, by comparing the observed values `y` with the predicted values `yhat` generated by the provided `model`.
```{r}
MSE <- function(y, model){
  yhat = predict(model) # Estimated y computed on the basis of the features
  mean((y-yhat)^2)
}

RMSE <- function(y, model){
  sqrt(MSE(y,model))
}
```

## Get MSE for basic linear model
```{r}
mse = MSE(y=train$quality, model=fit)
# Square root of MSE
sqrt(mse)
```

```{r}
#library(ggplot2)
#require(graphics)
#pairs(train)
#ggplot(cor(train))

#ggcorrplot(cor(train))
#heatmap(cor(train))

#plot(train$alcohol, train$quality)
#plot(train$total.sulfur.dioxide, train$free.sulfur.dioxide)
#abline(fit)
#cor(train)
```

## Optimizing linear model
Create a new linear model without considering citric.acid, chlorides and total.sulfur.dioxide
We get a SQMSE of 0.7534613 which is good
```{r}
fit_m3 = lm(quality ~ . -citric.acid -chlorides -total.sulfur.dioxide, data=train)
yhat = predict(fit_m3, newdata=test)
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=fit_m3)
write.table(file="fitLinearModelV2.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

Taking out also density, leads to a RMSE of 0.7583856 which is worse
```{r}
fit_m3n2 = lm(quality ~ . -citric.acid - chlorides - total.sulfur.dioxide - density, data=train) 
yhat = predict(fit_m3n2, newdata=test)
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=fit_m3n2)
```

Taking out residual sugar but not density, leads to a RMSE of 0.7627304 which is worse
```{r}
fit_m3n3 = lm(quality ~ . -citric.acid - chlorides - total.sulfur.dioxide - residual.sugar, data=train) 
yhat = predict(fit_m3n3, newdata=test)
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=fit_m3n3)
```




# Cross-Validation

## Validation set approach (5.1.1)
Suppose that we would like to estimate the test error associated with fitting a particular statistical learning method on a set of observations. The validation set approach is a very simple strategy validation for this task: it involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a training set and a validation set. The validation model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the set responses for the observations in the validation set. The resulting validation hold-out set set error rate, typically assessed using MSE in the case of a quantitative response, provides an estimate of the test error rate. In simpler words, the statistical learning method is fit on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set.

If we repeat the process of randomly splitting the sample set into two parts, we will get a somewhat different estimate for the test MSE.

Validation set approach drawbacks:
1. The validation estimate of the test error rate can be highly variable, depending on precisely which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the validation set.
2. Only a subset of the observations, those that are included in the training set rather than in the validation set, are used to fit the model. Since statistical methods tend to perform worse when trained on fewer observations, this suggests that the validation set error rate may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.

## Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (5.1.2)
A set of n data points is repeatedly split into a training set (containing all but one observation), and a validation set that contains only that observation (shown in beige). The test error is then estimated by averaging the n resulting MSEs. The first training set contains all but observation 1, the second training set contains all but observation 2, and so forth.

\[CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} MSE_i\]

LOOC has far less bias since we repeatedly fit the statistical learning method using training sets that contain n âˆ’ 1 observations, almost as many as are in the entire data set. This is in contrast to the validation set approach, in which the training set is typically around half the size of the original data set.
The LOOCV approach tends not to overestimate the test error rate as much as the validation set approach does.
Performing LOOCV multiple times will always yield the same results: there is no randomness in the training/validation set splits.

LOOCV has the potential to be expensive to implement, since the model has to be fit n times. This can be very time consuming if n is large, and if each individual model is slow to fit.

LOOCV is a special case of k-fold CV in which k is set to equal n. 

## K-fold crossvalidation (5.1.3)
We have to decide which portion of the dataset is for testing and what is for training. Of course we'd like to maximize both: maximizing the training data is useful to get the best possible result, while maximizing the test data is useful to get the best validation. A trade off is needed because all the point used in the training set cannot be used for the test set and vice-versa.

We partition the dataset in K partitions (also known as folds). For example if we have 200 data point and K=10 we'll have 20 partitions of 10 data points each.

Then, we run K separate learning experiments, each time selecting a different test set and using the remaining sets ad training data. At the end, we average the test results for those K experiments.

LOOCV is a special case of k-fold CV in which k is set to equal n. What is the advantage of using k = 5 or k = 10 rather than k = n? The most obvious advantage is computational. LOOCV requires fitting the statistical learning method n times. This has the potential to be computationally expensive. 

\[CV_{(k)} = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{k} MSE_i\]


##Cross-Validation on Classification Problems (5.1.5)
Cross-validation can also be a very useful approach in the classification setting when Y is qualitative. In this setting, cross-validation works just as described earlier, except that rather than using MSE to quantify test error, we instead use the number of misclassified observations.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Homework assignment
Choose a k for k-fold cross validation.
Make the plot of RMSE based on train data and cross-validation as a function of 1/K (K of KNN).
You can pre-select the most promising features to use in the KNN with the aim to improve the prediction accuracy. But be careful to the cross validation strategy to use.

#### Execution
We will now perform KNN using the knn() function, which is part of the knn() class library. Rather than a two-step approach in which we first fit the model and then we use the model to make predictions, knn() forms predictions using a single command.

##### Personal code
```{r}

k_values <- seq(from=10, to=50, by=5) # Define the values of K for cross-validation

# Perform k-fold cross-validation for each K value
for (k in k_values) {
  # Define the KNN control parameters for cross-validation
  # number: the number of folds
  ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, savePredictions = TRUE)

  # Define the KNN model
  model <- train(quality ~ ., data = train, method = "knn", trControl = ctrl, tuneGrid = data.frame(k = k), preProcess = c("center","scale") )

# Subset Selection (6.1)
## Best Subset Selection (6.1.1)

\[R^2 = 1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}\]

Find the best RMSE by trying all the possible combinations of features.
```{r}
# Data load
train <- read.csv("wineq_train.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
test <- read.csv("wineq_validation.csv", , stringsAsFactors=F)

# Create all possible combinations of features
all_features <- colnames(train)  # Assuming 'train' is your training data frame
all_features <- setdiff(all_features, "quality")  # Remove the dependent variable
feature_combinations <- lapply(1:length(all_features), function(x) combn(all_features, x))

# Fit models and calculate RMSE for each combination
best_rmse <- Inf
best_model <- NULL
for (i in seq_along(feature_combinations)) {
  combinations <- feature_combinations[[i]]
  for (j in 1:ncol(combinations)) {
    formula <- as.formula(paste("quality ~", paste(combinations[, j], collapse = " + ")))
    model <- lm(formula, data = train)
    rmse <- RMSE(train$quality, model)
    if (rmse < best_rmse) {
      best_rmse <- rmse
      best_model <- model
    }
  }
}

summary(best_model)
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=best_model) # We get a SQMSE of 0.7534613
yhat = predict(best_model, newdata=test)
write.table(file="bestSubsetSelectionV1.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
As the number of features increases, it may be possible to over fit the model.
Try to split the training set in 80-20% and use the 20% as a validation set. 

```{r}
# Data load
train <- read.csv("wineq_train.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
test <- read.csv("wineq_validation.csv", , stringsAsFactors=F)

# Take 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation 
set.seed(123)
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(train), 0.8*nrow(train))
partialTrain <- train[train_index,]
partialValidation <- train[-train_index,]

# Create all possible combinations of features
all_features <- colnames(partialTrain)  # Assuming 'train' is your training data frame
all_features <- setdiff(all_features, "quality")  # Remove the dependent variable
feature_combinations <- lapply(1:length(all_features), function(x) combn(all_features, x))

# Fit models and calculate RMSE for each combination
best_rmse <- Inf
best_rss <- Inf
best_model <- NULL
for (i in seq_along(feature_combinations)) {
  combinations <- feature_combinations[[i]]
  for (j in 1:ncol(combinations)) {
    formula <- as.formula(paste("quality ~", paste(combinations[, j], collapse = " + ")))
    model <- lm(formula, data = partialTrain)
    # Calculate RSS
    RSS <- sum(model$residuals^2)
    print(rss)
    
    rmse <- RMSE(partialTrain$quality, model)
    
    #if (rmse < best_rmse) {
    #  best_rmse <- rmse
    #  best_model <- model
    #}
    
      if (RSS < best_rss) {

      best_model <- model
    }

write.table(file="mySubmission2.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

```

### Forward Stepwise Selection
Forward stepwise selection is a computationally efficient alternative to best forward subset selection. While the best subset selection procedure considers all stepwise 2^p possible models containing subsets of the p predictors, forward stepwise considers a much smaller set of models. Forward stepwise selection begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model, one-at-a-time, until all of the predictors are in the model. In particular, at each step the variable that gives the greatest additional improvement to the fit is added to the model.
```{r}
# Data load
train <- read.csv("wineq_train.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
test <- read.csv("wineq_validation.csv", , stringsAsFactors=F)

baseModel <- lm(quality ~ 1, data = train)
FwStepSel <- step(baseModel, direction = "forward", scope = list(lower = baseModel, upper = lm(quality ~ ., data = train)))


#Based on the previous step results:
fit = lm(formula = FwStepSel$call$formula, data = train)
summary(fit)
yhat = predict(fit, newdata=test)

# Calc RMSE
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=fit)

# Put the prediction in a file for the submission on the platform
write.table(file="forwardStepwiseSelection.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

```
### Backward Stepwise Selection
Like forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection provides an backward efficient alternative to best subset selection. However, unlike forward stepwise selection, it begins with the full least squares model containing all p selection predictors, and then iteratively removes the least useful predictor, one-at-a-time.
```{r}
# Data load
train <- read.csv("wineq_train.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
test <- read.csv("wineq_validation.csv", , stringsAsFactors=F)

fullModel <- lm(quality ~ ., data = train)
BwStepSel <- step(fullModel, direction="backward")


#Based on the previous step results:
fit = lm(formula = BwStepSel$call$formula, data = train)
summary(fit)
yhat = predict(fit, newdata=test)

# Calc RMSE
RMSE(y=train$quality, model=fit)

# Put the prediction in a file for the submission on the platform
write.table(file="backwardStepwiseSelection.txt", yhat, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)

```

It is wrong to apply feature selection before CV...
Also scaling should be applied after validation.
